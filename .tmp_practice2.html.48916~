		<h2>Box Jellyfish are one of the most dangerous jellies in the world. T or F?</h2>
<div class="answer">
<p>True</p>
</div>

<h2>The worlds largest Jellyfish can grow over 120 feet long. T or F?</h2>
<div class="answer">
<p>True </p>
</div>

<h2>Are there good things about jellyfish?
</h2>
<div class="answer">
<p>Yes, jellyfish are very important animals in the ocean. We should definitely respect and not harm them.
 They are food for a number of marine animals such as large fish and turtles.
  Even humans eat jellyfish – yummy! Jellyfish also provide habitat for many juvenile fishes in areas 
  where there are not many places to hide. They can also protect the small fish from being eaten by 
  predators with their stinging cells. Also, many young crabs hitchhike on the top of jellyfish so 
  they don’t have to swim. </p>
</div>
<h2>What do they eat?
</h2>
<div class="answer">
<p>Jellyfish eat many different types of things, such as small plants (phytoplankton), 
copepods (crustacean zooplankton), fish eggs and other small fish called larvae; 
they also eat the planktonic eggs and young stages (also called larvae) of many different 
kinds of marine animals. Some jellyfish even eat other jellyfish! When jellyfish form blooms 
they eat almost everything in the water and this can cause problems for fisheries because there 
is no food left for the fish to eat! </p>
</div>
<h2>Why do some jellyfish sting?
</h2>
<div class="answer">
<p>Some jellyfish have millions of very small stinging cells in their tentacles called nematocysts.
 These cells are used to capture food by injecting toxin into the prey. When we are stung it hurts 
 because the toxin goes through our skin – ouch! </p>
